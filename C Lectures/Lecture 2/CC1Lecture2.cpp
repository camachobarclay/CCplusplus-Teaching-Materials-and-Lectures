/*
 * Typically, comments should be used for three things.
 * For a given library, program, or function, comments are
 * best used to describe what the library, program, or
 * function, does. 
 * 
 * Second, within a library, program, or function described
 * above, comments can be used to describe how the code is
 * going to accomplish its goal.
 * 
 * Finally, comments should be written in a way that makes
 * sense to someone who has no idea what the code does. It
 * is often the case that a programmer will say “It’s obvious
 *  what this does! There’s no way I’ll forget about this”. 
 * Guess what? It’s not obvious, and you will be amazed how
 * quickly you forget.
